= Workshop - Module 8

== 1. Greengrass Deployment

We have _Greengrass_ installed and configured and have created Lambda function which is supposed to run on the _Greengrass_ installation. In order to move any functionality to _Greengrass_ we need to create a deployment package which can be pushed down to the device. With a deployment package that gets successfully applied our _Greengrass_ installation essentially would remain without any functionality.

=== 1.1 Prepare Greengrass deployment

. In the _AWS_ console change to the _IoT Core_ service console, select *Greengrass* from the section on the left and then select *Groups*, you should see the *Greengrass Group* called `sbe_workshop` which was created in <<1.4,section 1.4>>

<mark>_***@TODO***_ Update the link to point to the right section.</mark>

. Select the group in order to check and change its configuration.

==== Setting up a Local Resource

A local resource on _Greengrass_ can be a locally connected device, e.g. a camera, or a folder in the local filesystem.

. Select *Resources* from the group options, then select the *Add a local resource* button.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_3.png[111_3]

. Name the new resource `tmp-folder` and select `Volume` from the *Resource type* options, set the *Source path* to `/tmp/src` and the *Destination path* to `/tmp/dst`, also check the option to `Automatically add OS group permission of the Linux group that owns the resource` from the *Group owner file access permission* options. Here we are mapping a local folder on the fielsystem to a logical resource path which we do use in the _Lambda_ code, i.e. the logical device is available in the local _Lambda_ container.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_4.png[111_4]

. We will affiliate the resource to the Lambda function in a later step so we can ignore that setting for the moment and hit the *Save* button.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_5.png[111_5]

. You should now see the newly created Resource in the list with a state of `Unaffiliated`.

==== Setting up the Lambda function

In this part we are identifying the _Lambda_ function on the cloud which should be deployed locally to run on _Greengrass_.

===== Add Lambda to Greengrass group

. Select the *Lambdas* option the sections on the lefthand side of the Greengrass group configuration and select to *Add your first Lambda*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_7.png[111_7]

. Select to *Use existing Lambda*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_8.png[111_8]

. From the list of existing Lambda functions select the function named `SBE-Workshop-Grengrass` which was created in Module 7 section 1.1 and select *Next*.

----
![111_9](/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_9.png)
----

. Select the latest version which is available for your Lambda function, in this case this should probably be `Version 1` and select *Finish*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_10.png[111_10]

. You should now see the newly created Lambda function in the list, note that `Using V1` denotes the version of the Lambda function which is being used for the deployment.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_11.png[111_11]

===== Configure Lambda function

. Now that the Lambda function has been created we need to change its configuration to ensure its smooth running, select the three horizontal dots and select *Edict configuration* from the dropdown menu.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_12.png[111_12]

. In the configuraiton screen we need to increase *Memory limit* to `128` *MB* and the *Timeout* to `5` *Minutes*, leave the rest of the configuration and select *Update*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_15.png[111_15]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_16.png[111_16]

===== Affiliate Local Resource with Lambda function

. After the update select the *Resources* option, time to affiliate the resource with our Lambda function, select *Add Resource*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_18.png[111_18]

. On the next screen choose *Select resource*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_19.png[111_19]

. From the list of resources (there should only be one) select `tmp-folder`.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_20.png[111_20]

. Then make sure you select the `Read and write access` option and select *Done* (top right).

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_22.png[111_22]

. Now that we've configured the resource we can select the *Save* button.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_23.png[111_23]

. _(Optional)_ Now when you check the *Resources* section you will see that the `tmp-folder` resource shows up as *Affiliated*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_25.png[111_25]

==== Setting up Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a mechanism that _Greengrass_ uses to ensure only allowed MQTT messages are flowing through the local broker. Here we are mapping incoming `MQTT` messages to the Lambda functions responsible for processing the messages. We also need to define which Lambda functions are allowed to communicate via `MQTT` with the _AWS IoT Core_ service or with other local Lambda functions or locally connected devices.

. Now in order for `MQTT` communication to work to and from _Greengrass_ we need to setup the necessary Subscriptions, select *Subscriptions* from the Greengrass group configuration and select *Add your first subscription*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_26.png[111_26]

. In the *Select a source* section select `IoT Cloud` and in the *Select a target* section select the `SBE-Workshop-Greengrass` Lambda function and select *Next*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_28.png[111_28]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_27.png[111_27]

. On the subsequent screen you get prompted provide a *Topic filter*, enter `sbeworkshop/s3event` as the topic filter and select *Next*, confirm the settings are correct and select *Finish*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_29.png[111_29]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_30.png[111_29]

. You will now see the first subscription in the list, select the *Add Subscription* to add another subscription.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_31.png[111_31]

. The *Source* will now be the `SBE-Workshop-Greengrass` Lambda function and the *Target* will be the `IoT Cloud` and the *Topic filter* needs to be specified as `sbeworkshop/s3complete`, select *Next* and then *Finish* to complete configuring the second subscription.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_32.png[111_32]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_34.png[111_34]

==== Configuring the _Greengrass_ settings

===== Greengrass group role

The service role we previously created for _Greengrass_ needs to be assigned to the _Greegrass_ group we created for use with this workshop.

. Select *Settings* from the _Greengrass_ group configuration and then click the *Add Role* link.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_35.png[111_35]

. On the following screen select the existing role which we configured in <<1.8.6,section 1.8.6>> and select *Save*.

<mark>_***@TODO***_ Update the link to point to the right section.</mark>

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_36.png[111_36]

. The permissions which we assigned to the role are now displayed on the Greengrass group's *Settings* screen.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_37.png[111_37]

===== Greengrass logging configuration

In order to allow for debugging of Lambda functions as well as ensure correct operation of _Greengrass_ itself we need to be able to collect and analyse log files. For _Greengrass_ to collect those locally or push them to _CloudWatch_ we need to use to the logging configuration section in the settings.

. Still on the *Settings* screen, scroll down to the *CloudWatch logs configuration* and the *Local logs configuration*, select the *Edit* link of the *Local logs configuration*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_38.png[111_38]

. Select to *Add another log type*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_39.png[111_39]

. Select to add `User Lambdas (recommended)` and to add `Greengrass system` and select *Update*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_40.png[111_40]

. Accept the default settings but take note that you can increase or decrease the logging level by changing the option in the *What level of logs should be sent?* dropdown box, you can also allocate the *Disk space limit* you want to use for each log file. Once you've reviewed the options select *Save* to update the configuration.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_41.png[111_41]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_42.png[111_42]

. _(Optional)_ You can configure the logging setting for _CloudWatch Logs_ as well.

=== 1.2 Deploying the Greengrass deployment package

Now that we have prepared all the code, and configuraiton settings for our _Greengrass_ installation we need to compile and push the deployment package down to _Greengrass_ running on our EC2 instance.

. Now that we've prepared all the parts for the deployment let's change to the *Deployments* section of the _Greengrass_ group.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_43.png[111_43]

. From the *Actions* dropdown menu select *Deploy*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_44.png[111_44]

. The very first time you are initiating a deployment you will get prompted how connectivity information is managed for devices local to the _Greengrass_ device, select *Automatic detection*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_46.png[111_46]

. On the next screen we get prompted to assign the _Greengrass_ service level permissions (this is separate from the group permissions we have assigned previously), select to *Grant permissions*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_47.png[111_47]

. You should see a notification saying *Started Greengrass Group deployment*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_48.png[111_48]

. If you switch back to the *Deployments* screen of the _Greengrass_ group configuration you can follow the *Status* of the deployment until it says either *Failed* (hopefully not) or *Successfully completed*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_49.png[111_49]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_50.png[111_50]

=== Testing the deployment

. In order to test the _Greengrass_ deployment, switch back to the _IoT Core_ console in your browser and select the *Test* option on the lefthand side, here you can subscribe to the topic `sbeworkshop/#` to monitor all MQTT messages, leave this page open in a dedicated tab.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_52.png[111_52]

*NB*: The use of the `#` wildcard in the topic will ensure that we will be able to see messages to both topics: `sbeworkshop/s3event` and `sneworkshop/s3complete`.

. Now open up the _S3_ service console in a new browser tab, and navigate into the bucket which we set up in <<1.7,section 1.7>> and navigate into the *upload* folder.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_53.png[111_53]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_57.png[111_57]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_58.png[111_58]

. In that folder select to *Upload* a file, select a file from your local file system and upload it, you can follow the progress bar until it is *100% Successful*.

image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_55.png[111_55]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_56.png[111_56]
image:/api/workshops/sbe-workshop-2018/content/assets/images/111_59.png[111_59]

. You can now switch back to the tab to the *IoT Core* console and confirm that you see at least one message on each topic for the file you have uploaded.
